SHORT BURST

grbm and sbpl:  both are good but appear like they may need a power-law component for the high-energy data.  Although, this may be the results of our misunderstanding for offsets between the GBM data and LAT data.



copl:  the highEcut is at the hard uppper limit which is 7000 keV.  NO errors possible bc of this.


grbm+lpow:  It is clear to see that the power-law component really only contributes to the LLE and LAT data, so it's unclear if this is an offset issue between detectors or if this is a characteristic of the burst emission.  Since offsets are not well known, we treat it as a characteristic of the burst.
SHOULD LOOK INTO OTHER SOURCES FOR THIS BURST TO SEE IF OTHERS USE AN OFFSET AND WHAT THEIR BEST MODEL IS.


*** LAT GRB catalog says grbm+lpow is the best model.


grbm+blackb and sbpl+blackb:  the bbody isn't significant.


copl+blackb:  the highEcut is at the hard uppper limit which is 7000 keV.  NO errors possible bc of this.


grbm+blackb+lpow:  looks good and reasonable parameters.  Good AIC and BIC.  Errors were possible.

sbpl+blackb+lpow: same as above.

copl+blackb+lpow: only 1 sigma errors.
